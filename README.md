# Fiftyville-SQL
## Description:
As part of the CS50x course I completed, I was given a task that involved using an SQL database to find the thief of a stolen duck, based on limited information. The database contained relevant data that could be used to identify the culprit. By successfully completing this task, I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in using SQL databases to organize and retrieve information, which is a valuable skill in various fields.

## Task:
The CS50 Duck has been stolen! The town of Fiftyville has called upon you to solve the mystery of the stolen duck. Authorities believe that the thief stole the duck and then, shortly afterwards, took a flight out of town with the help of an accomplice. Your goal is to identify:
1. Who the thief is,
2. What city the thief escaped to, and
3. Who the thiefâ€™s accomplice is who helped them escape
All you know is that the theft took place on July 28, 2021 and that it took place on Humphrey Street.
